1. Stateless Services
   Design stateless services because they don’t rely on server-specific data and are easier to scale.

2. Horizontal Scaling
   Add more servers so that the workload can be shared.

3. Load Balancing
   Use a load balancer to distribute incoming requests evenly across multiple servers.

4. Auto Scaling
   Implement auto-scaling policies to adjust resources based on real-time traffic.

5. Caching
   Use caching to reduce the load on the database and handle repetitive requests at scale.

6. Database Replication
   Replicate data across multiple nodes to scale the read operations while improving redundancy.

7. Database Sharding
   Distribute data across multiple instances to scale the writes as well as reads.

8. Async Processing
   Move time-consuming and resource-intensive tasks to background workers using async processing to scale out new requests.
